The Beginnings of Windows On and Universal Drivers on UEFI systems for The Best Computing Experience
https://www.worproject.ml/

## What's the Project?
The Windows on Raspberry Productions team (and many before them) have worked incredibly hard to bring you Windows 10 on the Raspberry Pi.
In show of support, this repository is intended to congratulate them on their efforts in making what seems at first impossible possible.
Here are some basic exercises to get you started with computing:
1. Hello World - Make an app that shows "Hello World" on your device
2. Light & Sound - Link up some lights and speakers to your device and control them using an app
3. Network - Link 2 or more devices together and make an app that works across all of them to provide an experience

## Why are you working on this?
There have been many efforts to bring affordable and reliable computing across the world, but each have faced
design challenges which prevent them from being the best products they could be for future generations to use.
It is somewhat incredible that these technologies exist in such quantity at such precision, but more cautious
development is required to produce it in ways which are robust, reusable and legacy friendly.

## How can I help?
You can contribute by learning about how complex things work
and look for ways they could be made easier for everyone to understand.

## What is "Windows On" and "Universal Drivers"?
Windows On is my concept for a Computer Operating System that connects Apps with Devices
to assist you in everyday life. Universal Drivers are a collectively decided set
of instructions which choose how Apps and Devices behave and work together.
Emphasis on Performance-Per-Watt, Low-Power and Environmental-Friendliness
were considered in light of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown measures
that occurred at the time of writing.
